## Attack plan !
- ### Make a bunch of Matrix related functions and code that :
  - [Multiply](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Produit_matriciel) matrixes line by line
  - A go routine Handeler that starts the routines and puts their results in the right order at their end
  - Test the performance of the go routines !!
  
- ### Create a System that :
  - Takes Strings and decodes them as two matrixes :
    - number of lines and rows of each
    - seperators
    - operator ( only multiply for now )
  - Creates the two matrixes from those Strings (Tricky i think)
  
- ### Learn and make a Communication handeler with TCP that will receive Strings from a client
  - create a the Server's **Machine a Etat**
  - then creat script that runs that machine
 
- ### Create Client that sends **valid** instructions to the server
  - maybe GUI, no idea
